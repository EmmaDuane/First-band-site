				<p>Tristen Elias AKA Tent8cle T is a 26 year old electronic musician and producer from Los Angeles.
				 He has been a musician from a young age, working with drums,the bass guitar and many other
				 instruments. Always having had an ear for improving song structures and complex inter-connected 
				 rhythms, he knew he wanted to become more than just an instrumental musician and move into the 
				 realm of  music production. Having studied the electronic music scene and other genres of live 
				 music and performances for over ten years, he began finally trying his hand at seriously 
				producing at the beginning of the pandemic, using the excess time to finally pursue his dream of
				 producing music full time. </p>
			
			<p>A fascination for deep sea creatures came from a young age as well. Lovecraftian cosmic horror 
				creating a major influence in the aesthetic of this artistic image, T also drew inspiration from
				 many other elements such as many sci-fi and fantasy films, games, and comic books/books. As a 
				child, T grew up by the ocean and was constantly wanting to be there when he was elsewhere. He 
				felt a strange calling to the sea and the deep darkness that remains less charted than our moon. 
				The name Tent8cle T was born from all these things.
			</p>
			<p>In a one year time span he has taken to live streaming DJ sets on the platform Twitch, going 
				from 0 followers to 150 in a 6 month span, and earning affiliate status. He has built a small, 
				but loyal community of friends and like minded music lovers. He calls them "The Tentacult." 
				They attend his weekly Tuesday stream called Tentacle Tuesdays, which is now getting close to 
				episode 20.

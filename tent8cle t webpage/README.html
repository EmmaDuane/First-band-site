    This website utilizes XHTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP, JavaScript, and mySQL. 
    The database portion of this project was done using mySQL Workbench and XAMPP on a windows x64 machine. 
    
    To run this program, please follow these steps:
    1. Download XAMPP version 8.0.6-0 from XAMPP's website. 
    2. Download PHP version 8.0.3 from PHP's website. 
    3. Download mySQL version 8.0.25 from mySQL's website. During the mySQL setup wizard, select the 
        option to download mySQL workbench. 
    4. Once mySQL workbench is installed, open it up and set up a local server. Name this local server 'XAMPP'.
        Set the host username to 'root' and the password to 'makaLoki2'. 
    5. Open and run the 'tent8cle_t_db.sql' script inside mySQL Workbench. Running this script should 
        create a new database inside the server called 'tent8cle_t_webpage' and three tables: users,
        audiouploads,and artuploads. 
    6. Locate the 'ZAMPP' folder in your computer's program files. Unzip 'tent8cle t webpage', move it to the 
        'htdocs' folder listed inside of the ZAMPP folder. 
    7. Go back to XAMPP, start the Apache and mySQL servers.
    8. Go to your preferred browser, in the search bar type 'localhost/tent8cle t webpage/index.php'.
    9. Stop the mySQL and Apache server when finished.
